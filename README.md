I'm a 24 year old student at Codam Coding College, Amsterdam. 
I'm also a part-time kite-surfing instructor in Wijk aan Zee, Noord-Holland. 
I enjoy learning new skills and teaching others. I love problem solving and puzzles. 
I'm currently looking for an entry position as a software developer at a company that is forward thinking and future oriented. 
I have experience in C, C++, embedded C++, networks, web-servers and teaching. 
Please feel free to contact me, i would be happy to answer any questions.
